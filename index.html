    <h1>Teaching Methods, Educational Setting, and Test Scores</h1>
    <p>Educational standards vary significantly depending on many variables.  For example, a school in the inner city might have a different student background than one in the countryside.  Large classrooms might have different instruction methods than smaller classrooms.  One of the ways to gauge theses standards is through standarized testing.  </p>
    <p>This project provides a way to see the effects of various educational settings on test scores.</p>
