    <p>Step 1: Select the field you would like to compare.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Select the value of the field you would like to graph</p>
    <p>Step 3: Hit the "Refresh" Button</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>It is best to limit comparisons to values of the same field, in order to avoid overlapping of data.</p>

    <p>The graph will plot the pretest scores on the x-axis and posttest scores on the y-axis, for the field and value selected.  The diagonal line is where pretest scores = posttest scores.  Data points towards the upper left represent students with the most score improvement, and data points towards the upper right represent students with the higher scores.</p>
